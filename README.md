# Application of Blockchain on Asset-backed Securities
## Abstract
Blockchain and Asset-backed securities are both very hot topics in recent years, this report is going to find how these two fit each other and inspire vitality in the finance industry.

## 1.What is an Asset-backed Security
### Definition
An asset-backed security is a kind of debt financing instrument that is collateralized by a pool of assets that can generate stable and regular cash flows stipulated by their terms, such as loans, leases, credit card debt, royalties or receivables. They are shares of the beneficial interest of a trust issued by a trustee representing a special purpose vehicle (SPV).The trustee shall undertake the obligation to pay the revenue from the asset-backed securities to the investors within the limit of the trust property itself. Its payments are based on the cash flow generated by the pool of assets backing the securities. The time this asset-backed security pays back the principal is closely related to the time when the underlying asset receives the cash flow, this is also the major difference between asset-backed security and other traditional debt financing instrument such as corporate bonds, mid-term notes and commercial papers.

### History
ABS was originated in the United States. Before the 1970s, the US government implemented strict supervision over the financial industry. After the 1970s, in order to cope with the multiple pressures from inflation and economic recession in the United States, the banking industry began a series of financial innovations, forcing the government authorities to relax financial supervision. The government's relaxation of financial regulations greatly promoted a series of financial innovations, including asset securitization. In 1968, The US Government National Mortgage Association packed up all its newly-issued mortgage loans as the underlying asset and issued the residential mortgage pass-through securities to raise funds for residential mortgage, which is essentially the mortgage-backed securities(MBS) today and opened the prelude of using MBS as a new means of financing. During this period, the ABS market has two important characteristics: 
   1. The ABS market developed extremely fast. However, it was only restricted in the United States, and a large number of housing loan institutions used asset securitization to disperse and transfer risks, and achieved good results; 
   2. The scope of the subjects of assets securitized is relatively small, that is, the development of asset securitization is dominated by MBS and limited to housing mortgage loans at that time.
   
After the 1970s, asset securitization has been widely applied in the United States. While the securitization of housing mortgage loans continues to expand, the securitized assets, besides housing mortgage loans, also extend to other kinds od assets, such as auto loans, credit card receivables and commercial loan. The ABS establishers of credit cards, auto loans and student tuition loans imitated the operation mode of MBS by putting a combination of the above new assets into an asset pool and issuing asset-backed securities. But MBS has always been the mainstream of asset securitization with the largest share. During this period, the ABS market has three important characteristics: 
   1. The underlying assets have been extended to a broader scope; 
   2. The concept of asset securitization has spread to developed countries in Europe. Asset securitization in Britain and France developed the fastest and to the highest degree, followed by Germany, Sweden, Italy and Spain. Due to the differences in legal system structure, the scale of asset securitization in Europe is far less than that in the United States; 
   3. MBS still dominates the US securitization market. 

ABS business started in China in 2005, the China Development Bank and China Construction Bank issued credit asset ABS respectively, and China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) also started pilot experiment on enterprise ABS. However, during the 2008 global financial crisis, China's asset securitization business was facing great public pressure, the CBRC immediately called a halt to the issuance of credit asset securitization products. It was not until 2011 that ABS in China restarted and new breeds of ABS such as asset-backed notes and were introduced, and more financial institutions had the rights to issue ABS. After year 2014, with the change of the examination method of credit ABS and enterprise ABS from pre-approval to post-filing, the issuance efficiency of asset securitization products has been greatly improved, and the information disclosure has been more complete. Chinaâ€™s ABS market entered the stage of vigorous development.

The chart below shows the development of ABS market in China (Source: Wind). We can see that the issuance volume of ABS exploded after year 2014. The ABS issuance volume between 2014 to 2018 is 330.98, 613.52, 884.69, 1,503.06 and 2,013.94 billion RMB, respectively.

## 2. Current Problems Existing in ABS Issuance
As a direct financing method by issuing securities in the capital market and money market, ABS is very popular among banks and asset management companies, because these Banks have the contradiction of short deposit and long-term loans, and asset management companies also have the pressure to recover bad assets. So issuing ABS can greatly reduce their risk.

However, ABS can be applied even broadly to small and medium-sized enterprises. Technically for them, as long as they have high-quality assets, they can obtain low-cost financing through ABS. That makes it easy for smaller, lower-rated institutions to raise low-cost funding. For example, an small company is the supplier of a multinational company, say China Petroleum, then it has money receivables from China Petroleum. It can issue account receivables ABS even if it is small, and get a AAA rating because the rating is given based on the cash flow stability in the future, and China Petroleum is not likely to default. So a small company can also issue debt-raising securities with very high ratings as long as they have high-quality asset that can generate stable cash flow. Ideally, ABS is a powerful tool to solve the financing difficulties and high costs of SMEs. However, this is often not the case in China. 

Originally, the innovation of ABS lies in the separation of main body rating and debt rating, but domestic ABS fails to achieve this. The main reason for this problem is that it is difficult for the rating agencies to be objective and fair in debt rating. Therefore, most people rely on the main body rating, which makes investors would rather trust the large institutions with high main body rating more, even if the ABS bond rating issued by these institutions is low. Taking consumer finance ABS as an example, the underlying assets of consumer finance are characterized by a large number of transactions, a small amount of money of each transaction and a high degree of diversification, which greatly increases the difficulty of debt rating. Therefore, investors, rating agencies, asset owners and market regulators all hold a wait-and-see attitude towards this kind of ABS.

## 3. What has Blockchian to do with ABS
As an independent underlying data storage and verification technology, blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, transaction traceability and so on. It can realize the transaction process in which all nodes jointly maintain a set of transaction ledger data and master and verify the contents of the ledger in real time, so that everyone can participate in the database recording.

In this way, the application of blockchain technology can realize the management of the whole life cycle of the underlying assets, including the data of the whole process of loan, repayment, overdue payment and transaction, so as to achieve the purpose of real-time monitoring and accurate prediction of cash flow. With these supports, problems such as multiple links, complex processes and poor transparency of underlying assets in ABS can be effectively solved, making debt rating more accurate.

The application of blockchain technology in ABS can improve the reliability and efficiency of ABS due diligence.For investors, it can enhance the transparency of the investment; For regulators, the requirements of penetrative audit and supervision can be satisfied to a greater extent; For the project side, it can increase investment revenue, reduce financing and communication costs, and improve the speed of capital flow.
