# Application of Blockchain on Asset-backed Securities
## Abstract
Blockchain and Asset-backed securities are both very hot topics in recent years, this report is going to find how these two fit each other and inspire vitality in the finance industry.

## 1.What is an Asset-backed Security
### Definition
An asset-backed security is a kind of debt financing instrument that is collateralized by a pool of assets that can generate stable and regular cash flows stipulated by their terms, such as loans, leases, credit card debt, royalties or receivables. They are shares of the beneficial interest of a trust issued by a trustee representing a special purpose vehicle (SPV).The trustee shall undertake the obligation to pay the revenue from the asset-backed securities to the investors within the limit of the trust property itself. Its payments are based on the cash flow generated by the pool of assets backing the securities. The time this asset-backed security pays back the principal is closely related to the time when the underlying asset receives the cash flow, this is also the major difference between asset-backed security and other traditional debt financing instrument such as corporate bonds, mid-term notes and commercial papers.

### History
ABS was originated in the United States. Before the 1970s, the US government implemented strict supervision over the financial industry. After the 1970s, in order to cope with the multiple pressures from inflation and economic recession in the United States, the banking industry began a series of financial innovations, forcing the government authorities to relax financial supervision. The government's relaxation of financial regulations greatly promoted a series of financial innovations, including asset securitization. In 1968, The US Government National Mortgage Association packed up all its newly-issued mortgage loans as the underlying asset and issued the residential mortgage pass-through securities to raise funds for residential mortgage, which is essentially the mortgage-backed securities(MBS) today and opened the prelude of using MBS as a new means of financing. During this period, the ABS market has two important characteristics: 
   1. The ABS market developed extremely fast. However, it was only restricted in the United States, and a large number of housing loan institutions used asset securitization to disperse and transfer risks, and achieved good results; 
   2. The scope of the subjects of assets securitized is relatively small, that is, the development of asset securitization is dominated by MBS and limited to housing mortgage loans at that time.
   
After the 1970s, asset securitization has been widely applied in the United States. While the securitization of housing mortgage loans continues to expand, the securitized assets, besides housing mortgage loans, also extend to other kinds od assets, such as auto loans, credit card receivables and commercial loan. The ABS establishers of credit cards, auto loans and student tuition loans imitated the operation mode of MBS by putting a combination of the above new assets into an asset pool and issuing asset-backed securities. But MBS has always been the mainstream of asset securitization with the largest share. During this period, the ABS market has three important characteristics: 
   1. The underlying assets have been extended to a broader scope; 
   2. The concept of asset securitization has spread to developed countries in Europe. Asset securitization in Britain and France developed the fastest and to the highest degree, followed by Germany, Sweden, Italy and Spain. Due to the differences in legal system structure, the scale of asset securitization in Europe is far less than that in the United States; 
   3. MBS still dominates the US securitization market. 

ABS business started in China in 2005, the China Development Bank and China Construction Bank issued credit asset ABS respectively, and China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) also started pilot experiment on enterprise ABS. However, during the 2008 global financial crisis, China's asset securitization business was facing great public pressure, the CBRC immediately called a halt to the issuance of credit asset securitization products. It was not until 2011 that ABS in China restarted and new breeds of ABS such as asset-backed notes and were introduced, and more financial institutions had the rights to issue ABS. After year 2014, with the change of the examination method of credit ABS and enterprise ABS from pre-approval to post-filing, the issuance efficiency of asset securitization products has been greatly improved, and the information disclosure has been more complete. Chinaâ€™s ABS market entered the stage of vigorous development.

The chart below shows the development of ABS market in China (Source: Wind). We can see that the issuance volume of ABS exploded after year 2014. The ABS issuance volume between 2014 to 2018 is 330.98, 613.52, 884.69, 1,503.06 and 2,013.94 billion RMB, respectively.

## 2.Current Problems in ABS Issuance
As a direct financing method by issuing securities in the capital market and money market, ABS is very popular among banks and asset management companies, because these Banks have the contradiction of short deposit and long-term loans, and asset management companies also have the pressure to recover bad assets. So issuing ABS can greatly reduce their risk.

However, ABS can be applied even broadly to small and medium-sized enterprises. Technically for them, as long as they have high-quality assets, they can obtain low-cost financing through ABS. That makes it easy for smaller, lower-rated institutions to raise low-cost funding. For example, an small company is the supplier of a multinational company, say China Petroleum, then it has money receivables from China Petroleum. It can issue account receivables ABS even if it is small, and get a AAA rating because the rating is given based on the cash flow stability in the future, and China Petroleum is not likely to default. So a small company can also issue debt-raising securities with very high ratings as long as they have high-quality asset that can generate stable cash flow. Ideally, ABS is a powerful tool to solve the financing difficulties and high costs of SMEs. However, this is often not the case in China. 

Originally, the innovation of ABS lies in the separation of main body rating and debt rating, but domestic ABS fails to achieve this. The main reason for this problem is that it is difficult for the rating agencies to be objective and fair in debt rating. Therefore, most people rely on the main body rating, which makes investors would rather trust the large institutions with high main body rating more, even if the ABS bond rating issued by these institutions is low. Taking consumer finance ABS as an example, the underlying assets of consumer finance are characterized by a large number of transactions, a small amount of money of each transaction and a high degree of diversification, which greatly increases the difficulty of debt rating. Therefore, investors, rating agencies, asset owners and market regulators all hold a wait-and-see attitude towards this kind of ABS.

What's more, external credit enhancement and the existence of compulsiery central entity may entail huge amount of transaction cost. Post-ABS cash flow management and credit trigger mechanism all require a lot of human input. Under a centralized framework, the way an authority record and collect all the information, and then distribute to the society will not only decreased the reliability and transparency of the data, but also make the transmitting efficiency low and the cost high.

## 3.What has Blockchian to do with ABS
As an independent underlying data storage and verification technology, blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, transaction traceability and so on. It can realize the transaction process in which all nodes jointly maintain a set of transaction ledger data and master and verify the contents of the ledger in real time, so that everyone can participate in the database recording.

In this way, the application of blockchain technology can realize the management of the whole life cycle of the underlying assets, including the data of the whole process of loan, repayment, overdue payment and transaction, so as to achieve the purpose of real-time monitoring and accurate prediction of cash flow. With these supports, problems such as multiple links, complex processes and poor transparency of underlying assets in ABS can be effectively solved, making debt rating more accurate.

The application of blockchain technology in ABS can improve the reliability and efficiency of ABS due diligence.For investors, it can enhance the transparency of the investment; For regulators, the requirements of penetrative audit and supervision can be satisfied to a greater extent; For the project side, it can increase investment revenue, reduce financing and communication costs, and improve the speed of capital flow.

## 4.Application of Blockchian in ABS
### Underlying Asset Type
From the real life experiment, blockchian technology suits debt rights asset the most. On one hand, the credibility issue can be solved with blockchain.For example, Consumer finance and auto loans both have the characteristics of small, scattered and stable cash flow, so they are naturally suitable for being the underlying assets of asset securitization. However, credit problems in Internet consumer finance have become an important obstacle to its financing, and blockchain can truly present the credit history of both parties without the help of a third party, which can effectively solve the credit problems in consumer finance. Similarly, credit problems caused by information asymmetry generally exist in supply chain finance ABS, such as bills, letters of credit, enterprise receivables, factoring claims, etc. The introduction of blockchain technology enables every transaction in the supply chain to be recorded and open to all participants. On the other hand, ABS' preference for risk diversification of underlying assets coincides with the decentralized nature of blockchain.

### ABS Construction
Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, encrypted security and non-tamper technical features, can participate in multiple processes and links of ABS from pre-establishment to post-establishment duration management.

(1) The formation of the underlying assets

At present, the application of blockchain to ABS mainly focuses on the formation process of underlying assets. On the one hand, with the use of blockchain technology, the authenticity of each underlying asset can be confirmed and shared by all participants, greatly reducing information asymmetry. In blockchain, if record details of every asset is open to all entities, it will provide huge support to the due diligence work the plan administrator does. The rating agencies may also be to analyze the quality of each asset rather than using sampling survey method due to the time and technology limitations, and law firm will to grasp the legal risk of the entire asset pool to a greater degree. Asset service agency can also be easily grasp the balance payments and the default condition, and investors can penetrate the underlying assets to see whether it is a good deal. On the other hand, in the ABS structure of cyclic purchase, there is a risk of declining asset quality of cyclic purchase. For example, the initial pool of assets is very good, but in the second circle it may buy a batch of assets whose default rate is higher. Due to information asymmetry, it is not easy to detect, and the risk will not be exposed until the duration monitoring, so the risk cannot be prevented in advance.If all intermediaries, such as asset service agencies, and managers, rating agencies, lawyers and accountants, can see every real asset purchased in a cycle on the chain and evaluate the newly pooled assets, the quality of underlying assets can be guaranteed at a high level

(2)Ratings of different layers

At present, rating agencies usually extract data from static pools to calculate default risk for accounts receivable ABS such as consumer finance and auto loans.The information quality of static sample pool data will have an important impact on the evaluation of credit quality of underlying assets. In actual project operations, the static pool samples are completely provided by the enterprise.The completeness, unbiasedness, dispersion, representativeness and consistency of samples may have some deviations. After the introduction of blockchain technology, we will have a more detailed and unchangeable record of pre-loan examination, post-loan monitoring and fund pay back activities. The rating agencies are free to objectively select representative samples in accordance with the scientific sampling method, or even select the whole sample. In this way, the samples can better represent the real quality and provide a greater guarantee for the assets.At the same time, blockchain technology can help realize the analysis of each asset in the dynamic pool.

(3)The transfer of the underlying assets

Every transfer of assets is recorded in a complete and authentic way on the blockchain, which is convenient to track the ownership of assets, and can effectively prevent the phenomenon of "multiple sales". On the other hand, transactions on the blockchain are implemented through scripts to reduce human intervention, and smart contracts can be built in to improve the efficiency and convenience of asset transfer.

(4)Duration monitoring of underlying assets

Duration monitoring of the underlying assets is a comprehensive work, including statistical distribution characteristics, default rate and recovery rate. At present, plan administrators can only rely on the data provided by enterprises, which makes it difficult to make an accurate judgment. They can only assume that the information provided by enterprises is true and reliable. The introduction of blockchain technology is similar to the formation and transfer of the above assets. Both of them rely on the open and sharing spirit of blockchain to strictly track and monitor the duration of the entire asset pool, so as to facilitate data analysis and processing.Meanwhile, the actions of recording every asset and overdue payment on the blockchain is naturally another form of information disclosure.

(5)Securities trades in the secondary market

At present, the lack of liquidity in ABS secondary market is a major problem in the development of ABS. ABS holders are recorded on the blockchain, and even as blockchain is formed between different blockchains, investors can share the underlying asset status of ABS, which provides a transparent and safe trading platform for ABS transactions.On the other hand, blockchain technology can improve the efficiency of securities registration, transaction and settlement, and meet the supervision and auditing requirements.

### Realtime Development
By the end of year 2018, there are 5 blockchain-supported ABS issued in China, raising a total amount of 1.86 bn RMB.

(1)Underlying asset type

The underlying assets of the 5 ABS all belong to debt rights assets, which include consumer finance receivables, supply chain receivables and auto loans, which to some extent proved that blockchian technology suits debt rights asset the most.

(2)Blockchain technology provider

There are two main types of blockchain technology providers. One is the financial branch companie of big Internet companies represented by Baidu Finance and JD Finance; The other is the fintech companies such as Kaiyuan Finance.The advantage of the former lies in the relatively mature technology foundation and the ability of continuous development. More importantly, some of the companies carrying out consumer finance business can provide underlying assets as the original stakeholders while providing technology at the same time. So it has a charateristic that integrates the original stakeholders, asset service providers and information technology providers together.The advantage of the latter is that they are familiar with the trading rules of the capital market and have relatively rich experience in the operation of the capital market.

(3)Issuance scale

Currently on the market there are only issued 5 single ABS products totalled 1.86 billion yuan, and they differ in product structure, the types of underlying assets, and relevant participants. It reflects that the blockchain technology in the ABS industry has not yet formed a mature model, and is still in the exploratory stage. At the same time, it also means that there is still a vast space for blockchain to be discovered in the field of securitization.
